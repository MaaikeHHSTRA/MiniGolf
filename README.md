This game was made as a university project.

The game was suppposed to have 3D graphics, realistic physics engine and an AI.

The framework we used was libgdx.

This is a goood example of a intermediate level libgdx project.

You can freely use it for reference
except for the projects at the given university.

To use (with intellij idea):
- download the project as zip file and unzip
- open with intellij idea as a new project
- use gradle to import the configuration
- then you will probably have to link the apache_math library in project structure 
- change java configuration/link junit again
- the game should run then

The data of course is saved in 
  - /lib/course.txt
